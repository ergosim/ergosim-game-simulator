# Ergosim :: game :: simulator

Ergosim simulates the performance of financial investments over time while offering comparisons between both ergodic and 
non-ergodic investment strategies. The game provides access to simple mechanics and a limited amount of simulations that
can be run inside a web browser. This provides an entry to our services, and hopes to generate interest in the topic of 
ergodicity as it relates to financial investments.
